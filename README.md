# Proof of Interaction

## Project Description

**Proof of Interaction** is a decentralized application (DApp) that tracks user interactions for on-chain engagement. The project leverages smart contracts to record and log interactions on the blockchain, providing a transparent and verifiable proof of actions taken by users. Each interaction is timestamped and stored on-chain for traceability and accountability.

## Smart Contract Address

The deployed smart contract for Proof of Interaction can be found at the following address:


## Features

- **Track Interactions:** Every time a user interacts with the contract, their actions are logged with a timestamp.
- **On-Chain Engagement:** All interactions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## How to Interact

1. **Deploy the Contract:** Use the provided smart contract address to interact with the Proof of Interaction contract.
2. **Call Functions:** Call the relevant functions to log your interactions with the contract.
3. **Track Events:** Each interaction will emit events that can be traced for proof of engagement.

## Usage

To interact with the smart contract, you can use platforms like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or integrate it into your DApp for seamless interaction tracking.
